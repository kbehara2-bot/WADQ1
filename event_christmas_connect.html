<h2>The Christmas Connect</h2>

<p><b>Date:</b> 24 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Venue:</b> KRC Lawn</p>

<p>
The Christmas Connect invites participants to pick a pre-designed card with one of several prompts — for example: “Things that happened this year that I wish happened to you too,” “A piece of advice I learned this year,” “Something that gave me hope recently,” “A compliment I think everyone deserves to hear,” “If I could gift you one feeling today, it would be…,” or “My wish for you in 2026.”
Participants write heartfelt messages on cards and place them on the Card Wall or Giving Tree. After adding their own card, participants may take any card written by someone else to keep. The goal is to create a warm exchange of kindness and reflection.

Alongside the card exchange, a book donation box will be open to students, faculty, and staff. All donated books will be wrapped as gifts, and on 25 December Bookscape will visit an orphanage to distribute these books and other essentials — extending the spirit of giving beyond the event.
