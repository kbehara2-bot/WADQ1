Bookscape’s flagship Pen Pal Programme spans one month and involves anonymous letter exchanges between participants. Interested students register via a Google form and digitally sign event rules. Each participant is randomly assigned a pen pal; issuing and receiving of letters happens on designated exchange days under club supervision. Envelopes and seals are provided to add to the excitement and ensure privacy.
