<h2>Meet, Read, Repeat</h2>

This initiative provided a relaxed, supportive environment designed as a peaceful break from daily routines. Students were invited to bring their own books — academic, fiction, or personal reads — and spend time reading in the shared presence of peers with a common interest.
</p>

<p>
The main purpose was to create a quiet, collective reading space that encouraged focused reading and promoted inner calm and well-being through a shared literary experience.
