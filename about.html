<h2>About Bookscape</h2>

<p>
Bookscape is the official book club of GITAM, created to bring together students who share a love for reading, storytelling, and meaningful discussions. The club provides a welcoming space where readers of all genres can connect, exchange ideas, and explore new books together.
</p>

<p>
We conduct monthly reading circles, creative discussions, and interactive events that encourage students to read more and share their perspectives. Bookscape also aims to build a vibrant reading culture on campus by hosting engaging activities and providing a supportive community for budding readers and writers.
