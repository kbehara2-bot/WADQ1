<h2>Pen Pal Programme</h2>

<p><b>Date:</b> February - March 2025</p>
<p><b>Venue:</b> Club-run correspondence (month-long)</p>

<p>
The Pen Pal Programme ran across an entire month, during which participants anonymously exchanged letters. 
Members wrote thoughtful messages to unknown partners, and identities were revealed only during the final exchange, 
making the experience exciting and deeply personal.
</p>

<p>
This initiative grew far beyond expectations and attracted a large number of students across different departments. 
Thanks to the overwhelming participation and the heartwarming feedback we received, the Pen Pal Programme was officially 
selected as Bookscape’s <b>flagship event</b>.
</p>

<p>
The event strengthened community bonds, encouraged expressive writing, and created memorable literary connections among participants.
