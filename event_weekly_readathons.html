<h2>Weekly Readathons</h2>

<p><b>Start Date:</b> 19 December 2025 (recurring weekly)</p>
<p><b>Venue:</b> MBA Classroom</p>

<p>
The Weekly Readathons provide a calm, supportive environment for students to read together in quiet companionship.
Inspired by our earlier "Meet, Read, Repeat" session, these weekly sessions invite participants to bring their own books and spend focused time reading alongside peers.
The sessions aim to foster concentration, encourage regular reading habits, and create a gentle, non-judgmental space for literary engagement.
